OpenStreetMap (Overpass API) | Building heights | Depends on user edits; typically updated every few days to few weeks | Crowdsourced; very fresh in cities, slower in rural areas.
Open Elevation API (based on SRTM, ASTER) | Ground elevation | ~2000-2013 (depending on region) | Derived from NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and ASTER data.
Nominatim (OpenStreetMap Geocoding) | Address â†’ lat/lon lookup | Real-time (from latest OSM edits) | Updated daily as new OSM edits flow in.
