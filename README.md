Julian's Point Mapper

(The OpenStreetMap version)

If you don't want to use LIDAR data (more accurate, more obstructions considered), this application is faster and lighter by a lot. If accuracy of results is paramount, there's a python application which takes geotiff or las files as input and performs similar analyses using first bounce data, https://github.com/davidemerson/jpmapper-lidar

A golang cli which
 * takes address or lat/lon
 * uses the openstreetmap to calculate:
    * distance,
    * sample elevation
    * check terrain
    * check buildings and obstructions mid-path
    * report on fresnel zone obstruction.

## build
* grab jpmapper.go
* install golang
* `go build jpmapper.go`
* run the resultant binary

## freshness
The OpenStreetMap Overpass API is used to get building heights, which are as fresh as a few hours old in some cities, but not more than a year old generally.

The Open Elevation API is more stale, since that's topo maps. The ground doesn't change a lot, which is great. Won't be older than about Y2K.

The OpenStreetMap Geocoding (address lookup from lat/lon) is updated daily.

## example
```
% ./jpmapper -addr1 "144 Spencer St, Brooklyn, NY" -addr2 "303 Vernon Ave, Brooklyn, NY" -freq 5800 -debug
